// Create factory function with single instance for gameboard, displayController
let Gameboard = function() {
  // Create an array with 3x3

  // Has player 1 and player 2 (Human or Computer)

  // Evaluate 3 straight rows / columns / diagonal X or O counts as win

  // Game is best of 5
}

// The focus is to make the Tic Tac Toe working in the console first.

// The UI can be implemented later since we are first learning to implement the main logic
